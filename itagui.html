            <h2>History of Itagüí</h2>
            <p class="ita11">Founded in 1743, Itagüí was declared a municipality in 1832. Its name comes some historians of an indigenous chief named Bitagüí. Two of its most representative Diego Echavarría Misas and Eladio Vélez.
                There were two chapels in Itagüí in colonial times. One in the place of the Tablaza that had been owned by Bruno Saldarriaga, built thanks to the permission that the Bishop of Popayán Francisco José de Figueredo granted December 19, 1743. Francisco Riaza and Bruno Saldarriaga who Lot more to the small temple, gave an extension of thirty blocks for the drawing of a population. This chapel was what later came to be elevated to the status of parish.
